- Basic difference between Linux flavours is that Ubuntu or Debian based flavours use 'apt-get' and fedora or other same one
uses the 'yum'

- cmd -> echo $SHELL , o/p -> the path to the shell which is being used

- cd /root/Desktop  // this navigation is also correct, no need to 1st execute cd ~ then go to Desktop

Commands ->

- whoami // to find who is logged in the system
- hostname // It is used to obtain the DNS(Domain Name System) name and set the system's hostname or NIS(Network Information System)
  domain name. A hostname is a name which is given to a computer and it attached to the network. Its main purpose is to uniquely
  identify over a network.

- ls /home/                 // to know the users
- visudo  /etc/sudoers  // it is to edit file which is configuration file that allows u to add or remove the rights to run cmds
 look for the string 'wheel' the users in this group can run all cmds 
- cat /etc/group // to list the groups
- cat /etc/shadow // it is for the password of the users we create it
- less /etc/passwd 	// to list the users and follow link to understand the logs ->
		https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-list-users-in-linux/

- 'passwd' cmd allows u to change the password for the user
- sudo passwd user_name // now u can change the password for the entered user if u enter username as root then it will
change the password for root 
  
  Adding a New Non-Root User in Kali Linux -> https://thecrazybastard.com/how-to-add-a-new-user-in-kali-linux/
  
- Screenshot(515)

- su username // to change user

- 'useradd' cmd is used to create a user
- usermod -G groupname username // to change the group for a user
cmd imp -> useradd -g groupname -s /bin/bash -c "Description msg" -m -d /home/username username // this cmd will done the all work
together mostly used in IT by system admin to add user
    // -m is going to create a default home directory for this
    // user, -s is used for allowing the user to use the shell
    // which we provide and here it is bash 
    // -g is the default user flag and user will be assigned to 
    // the group u mention, always use -g flag with the 'users'
    // group, -c flag is used for providing the comments

- groups                 // this will show u that to which groups ur current user is connected too.
- sudo groupadd name_of_group           // to add the new group
- sudo groupdel name_of_group           // to delete the group
- sudo gpasswd -a user_name group_name  // assign user to a group
- sudo gpasswd -d user_name group_name // to remove user from the group
Note -> on doing cmd in home directory -> ls -ltr // u might see that the username and groupname for the user is same even after
changing it and the reason for that the actual group of the user will always remain the username it is just now part of the another
group to change it properly use the 
cmd -> chgrp -R groupname username // this will make changes to every folder of the username 

- 'userdel' cmd is used to delete the user
- sudo userdel user_name // it will delete the user but it will not delete the directory of the user which u can see by using          
  cmd -> ls /home/, Hence the user will be deleted but his data will not
- sudo userdel -r user_name   // this will delete the home directory also with the user
- sudo rm -r /home/mark/      // this will remove all the data of the user, So use it carefully


# Monitor User ->
- who // to see how many people r logged in
- last // this will tell u about the every user logged in ever in system, for not whole list just unique names of all users logged
  so far use cmd -> last | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq
- w // it is same work as 'who' but gives more detailed info related
- finger // it is to do trace of ur user where it is coming from what kind of protocol he is using
- id username //to see uid and gid and to know whether user is existing or not

- users // to list the users logged in the system
- wall // this will broadcast or msg to anyone who is logged in the linux system
- write username_to_send_them // it for specific user to another

Note -> In Linux their r 2 types of accounts ->
- local account // which is created normally with above cmds
- Domain/Directory account // when u need to addd user for access to 1000 servers then we use these accounts, the client will send
a send a request to the Directory server to authenticate and in response the server tells that the user is authenicated and allowed
to log in, in windows their is AD(Active Directory) here u do the same as u create a Account in Active Directory of the Windows Server
, the protocol used for this task is LDAP protocol to authenticate against a directory

Diff bw AD, LDAP, IDM, WinBIND, OpenLDAP -> https://academy.ehacking.net/courses/551622/lectures/10003046

cal - this cmd is for calculator
bc - this is for binary calculator
uptime - this tells how long the system being up for and load, users etc. Screenshot(521)



Types of help commands -> Screenshot(415)
- man any_cmd (this gives the manual of the cmd) // we can also use --help in the place of 'man' Ex -> any_cmd --help

- 'whatis' cmd will display short manual page discription for cmd -> whatis ls

- which cmd is used to return the path name of a file or a command which we use with this 'which' cmd
- which ls //to know the location of the ls cmd
- In bash scripting it is gud practice to use the full path name as we should use -> '/bin/ls' instead of just 'ls' , bcz some
  OS recognize the 'ls' cmd and some will require u to enter the full path for the 'ls' cmd

- ip addr // for seeing IP related data

- ifconfig              // to show ethernet settings and other internet config things, if 'eth0' is their in o/p then it means
                        // their is wired connection , if u see 'wlan0' then it is wireless connected, additional ethernet
                        // connections would be shown as 'eth1' and so on
                        // 'lo' is a loop back interface which is a special interface which system uses to communicate with
                        // itself, 'inet addr' is the local are LAN address or NAT address, 'RX packets' is the received packet
                        // 'TX packet' is the transmitted packet
- ifconfig eth1         // it will now show details for 'eth1' interface only
- ifconfig eth0 up      // this will enable the internet connection
- ifconfig eth0 down    // this will disable the internet connection

- ipcalc ip_Address   // very usefull tool to understand Network segments such as Host, Network, Network Type, range etc

- 'sudo' cmd allows extra privilages as administrator or more then normal user
- 'sudo' infront of any cmd will enhance the privilage criteria for that cmd
- su - // to become root user
- sudo -s       // this will give u the root user privilages which is super user mode
- sudo su    // To go to the root user and give root permissions)
- -su // to login as root

- login -p username // to login into system

- pwd       // This cmd shows the current working directory

- ls        		// To list the files present in directory
- ls option_cmd directory_name      // syntax for ls cmd
- ls Documents          // this will list all the files which r in Documents directory
- ls -al                // this will show the hidden files and the details about all files
- ls -ltr		// to list every thing in timely reverse order 
- ls -li 		// to list the inodes 
- ls -sh		// to display size in human readble format

- mkdir directory_name // to create the directory

- rm filename                       // to remove a file
- rm -r parent_directory_name       // this will remove the file and the directory's also

- cp options_cmd src des        // 'cp' is used as copy command 'src' is the source from which we wants to copy and 'des' is
                                // the destination where we wants to copy
- cp file1 file2                // this will copy data of file1 to file2 and create file2 if it does not exist
- cp file1 dir1                 // this will copy file1 to dir1 directory

- mv options_cmd src des // syntax for mv
- mv file1 file2 // this will move data and rename file and directories so here file1 will be renamed as file2 and if file2
                 //  doesn't exist it will be created
- mv file1 dir1 // this will move file1 to dir1 directory and if file1 exists then the data in it will be overwritten
- mv -v file1 dir1      // for the verbose mode

- cat options_cmd filename1 filename2 .... // syntax for cat
- cat               // this will allow u to write something on terminal and echo things u enter
- use ctrl+d to come out of 'cat' cmd
- cat file_name // to display contents of the file
- cat filename1 filename2 // this will combine and display the contents of two files

- 'touch' cmd is a way to create files in linux it is also used to change the timestamps on existing files and directories, u 
  cannot use 'touch' cmd to create directories
- touch filename                        //syntax to create a new file
- touch hello.sh  //.sh extention is not necessary but for editor it is usefull, it is also best practice to provide extension
- touch file1     // file1 should be already exist now the timestamp of the file would be the current time

Linux File Editor -> Screenshot(427)
vi or vim cmds -> Screenshot(428)

VIM Editor ->
- sudo apt-get install vim // to install vim
- vim name_of_file_to_edit // open the editor with file open
- vim file.txt // to create a file
      - press i // to insert
      - press esc to exit the insert mode
      - :w // to save
      - :q // to exit
      - :wq // to save and close the file or we can also use ZZ for the same task
      - :q! // to exit file without saving
      - press o // to get into the next line , don't press it in the insert mode

- nano filename // this will create the file if not exists
- ctrl+o // to save the data in file and then press enter
- other common cmds which will be used in nano editor will be already listed at bottom of the editor

- 'top' cmd provides dynamic real time view of ur system, Suppose u wants to know which process in ur computer is taking most
of the CPU etc then use cmd -> top // a window will appear with data, Here PID -> Process ID, in linux every program and 
process has it's own ID, u can see CPU usage, Memory usage etc
- 'top' refreshes the data of process usage table in every 3 seconds bydeafult
- U can change the delay time from 3 seconds to other interval also by pressing 's' after 'top' cmd is executed
- To filter out ideal processes(processes u need not to know as they will always we running) press 'i'
- To kill any process press 'k' and then enter the 'pid' of the process

- pidof process_name // to find the pid of process

- kill -flags pid_of_process        // syntax for kill cmd
- kill pid_no                       // to kill the process
- kill -KILL pid_no                 // this will force kill only use when needed
- kill -9 pid_no                    // this also a kind of force kill but not as powerfull as -KILL

- ps -ux            // to get the long list of all running processes this is usefull in knowing the name of process or the
                    // process id of some process
- ps -aux           // the 'ps -ux' gives processes list for the current user only, to know all the processes by all users use
                    // 'ps -aux' cmd
- ps -U user_name   // this will give all the processes of the entered user
- ps -C name_of_process     // this will list out all the instances or processes which r related to process entered

Free resources and Used Resources ->
- df        // this cmd reports the amount of Disk space being used and avilable by ur file system
- df -h     // displays the data in more human readable format
- du        // this cmd is used to estimate and display disk space used by files, navigate into the directory on which u wants
            // to use this cmd and in the last of all listing it will shoe u the size of the folder
- du -h     // displays the data in more human readable format
- du -sh    // '-s' is for summary , 'h' is for human redable, this will calculate the disk space and all of it used
- du -sh foler_name     // to know the details for the following folder
- free      // dispalys the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system as well as the buffer used by
            // the kernel, the data associated by the title-> -/+ buffers/cache // displays the whole memory used by ur machine
- free -b   // 'b' is for byte we can also use 'k' in place of 'b', k is for kilobyte , 'm' is for megabyte, 'g' for gigbyte and
            // 't' for terabyte


- updatedb 	// this will build the database for file and directory, use this before using locate but not all the time, once
 when u start using kali linux just execute it in starting.

- locate file_name // the locate will help u to find the file in whole computer or all the directories and places

- find // on executing it, this will search for everything
- find /etc -name file_name // now this will search the file only in etc folder, so put the location in 2nd param 
- find /etc -name p* // this will search for every file which starts with p in the given location

'locate' uses a prebuilt database, which should be regularly updated, while 'find' interates over a filesystem to locate
files, thus locate is much faster then find, but can be inaccurate if the database(can be seen as a cache) is not updated

- 'head' and 'tail' cmds generally we use them with files, So 'head' cmd could be used to output the first part of the file and  
  the 'tail' cmd could be used to output the last part of the file
- Bydefault 'head' will print first 10 lines and 'tail' will print last 10 cmds
- head file_name        // syntax for head
- tail file_name        // syntax for tail
- head -nNumber_of_lines file_name  // to give limit for the no. of lines to display, no space between -n and Number_of_lines
- tail -nNumber_of_lines file_name  // to give limit for the no. of lines to display
- head -Number_of_lines file_name   // works same as cmd -> head -nNumber_of_lines file_name 
- head file1 file2          // to see first 10 lines of multiple files
- head -Number_of_lines file1 file2     // to see first desired number of lines for multiple files

- sort filename // this to sort the data in the given file based on Alphabets

- nl filename // this to display the file with no.'s on the terminal
- nl -s '# ' -w 6  filename // this to display the file with no.'s with # displayed after no.s on the terminal using the
	flag '-s' and '-w' is the no. width used to display data properly


- 'wc' cmd or wordcount prints a count of new lines, words and bytes for each input file
- wc file_name  // o/p -> 1 6 42 file_name , here ist param '1' represents the no. of lines in file, 2nd param '6' represents
                // the no. of words and 3rd param '42' represents the no. of characters in file and 4th is name of file
- wc -c file_name   // this will give the no. of bytes or no. of characters in file
- wc -l file_name   // this will give the no. of lines in file
- wc -w file_name   // this will give the no. of words in file
- wc -L file_name   // this will give the length of the longest line in file

- tac filename // tac is opposite of cat as it displays the data from top to bottom

- cat filename|sed 's/t/T'	// here in 's/t/T' the 's' is for substitude hence it will replace the 't' with 'T' for every
		first 't' char in the file
		Note -> These changes will not be saved

- sed 's/t/T/g' filename // here in 's/t/T/g' the 'g' which is global is to tell that substitude every 't' character with 'T'

- sed -i 's/t/T/g' filename // here in 'i' will make the changes to the original file
Sed tutorial -> https://academy.ehacking.net/courses/551622/lectures/10003044

- 'grep'(global regural expression print), 'grep' cmd processes text line by line and print any line which matches the 
  specified pattern, So 'grep' cmd could be used to search some kind of pattern or word or sentence in a text file or
  no. of text file
- grep "word_or_text_to_search" file_name // this cmd will search the entered word from the input file, and the 'grep' cmd is     
                                         // sensitive case hence the exact word or text would be searched 
- grep -i "word_or_text_to_search" file_name  // to make the search not case-sensitive
- grep -n "word_or_text_to_search" file_name  // to print the line no. with output 
- grep -c "word_or_text_to_search" file1 file2 file3  // to search in multiple files, -c will count the word or text
- grep -n "word_or_text_to_search" *      // to search from all the files
- grep -nv "word_or_text_to_search" file_name    // this will o/p all the lines which doesn't contain the input text

- 'less' cmd is used for reading the file or to search something inside the file, 'less' is better then the cat cmd to read
  the  file contents as the size of the opened terminal window will not create any hurdle to display the data which was too
  big and we were not able to scroll further in terminal
- less filename     // to read the data from the file and scroll the content of file as u proceed by scrolling
    - press space after executing above cmd will display the data on terminal page by page
    - press shift + B to go up the pages
    - press shift + G to go at end of the file
    - press g       // this go at the top of the file
    - /book         // this is search for the 'book' keyword in file and to go to next 'book' in file press 'n'
    - ?book         // to search for 'book' in file from down to up
    - press 'q' to quit from less

Wildcards -> Screenshot(352, 353, 354)
{} widlcard, Ex -> touch abcd{1..9}-xyz // this will create 9 files with name as abcd1-xyz to abcd9-xyz

Run multiple cmds together -> we can use ';' for combining cmds
- ls ; pwd          // now the o/p would be combination of both cmds and they will be executed from left to right
- date ; CAL ; pwd  // here 'CAL' is a wrong cmd but still other cmds will be executed it will just gave the error for 2nd cmd
- ls && pwd         // we can use '&&' in place of ';' and gives the same output
- the only difference between ';' and '&&' is that the ';' will execute every cmd regardless of other cmds have been executed
  successfully of not but with '&&' if the previously executed cmd is failed it will not execute the other left cmds
- ls || pwd         // here it will give output for 'ls' only bcz here logical OR is applied as if any of the cmd is successful
                    // it will not execute other cmds

File System Paths -> Absolute and Relative Paths -> Screenshot(355)

Remote Access to different OS -> Screenshot(356)

Soft and Hard Links -> Screenshot(358)
to create a soft link use cmd -> ln -s full_path_to_file // to verify if link is done to ls -al and u will see that the filename is
directing to the path of the file, now if u will do the change in the original file then the link file would be also change
accordingly -> ls -li // to list the inodes
The inodes for the soft link is different from the original file of which it is link and if the original file is deleted the content
in the soft link will also not appear as the file is removed but in hard link even if the original file is removed the hard link file
still show the content.
Note for hard link -> Screenshot(359)
When a hard link is created it would not be shown as 'link' in details instead shown as normal file and also when u do ls -al u will
not see the filename is directing to the path of the file like in soft link

route // display existing kernel routing table entries

netcat // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbz8wQLz2Sw&list=PLZOToVAK85MpiuxbK7Sg6CtQtlW9QygC-&index=4

- tcpdump -D // lists the interfaces which tcpdump is capable of Listening or capture from
- tcpdump -i interface_name -nn // to capture traffic on particular interface, -nn will display the ports instead of protocol 
  Ex -> http will be shown as 80 using -nn
- tcpdump -w file_name.pcap '(src src_IP and dst dst_IP) or (src src_IP and dst dst_IP)' // to capture packets on desired hosts
networks, -w is to write captured data to file with extension pcap
- tcpdump -r file_name.pcap // to read file with captured packets
- tcpdump host host_ip_address port 80 // use 'port' to define port
- tcpdump -i eth0 -v src port 443 and dst dst_IP_address // here we r defining src port and and destination IP address
- tcpdump -i eth0 tcp net 192.168.1.0/24  // to capture traffic on subnet and only show TCP data only

Note -> use tcpdump to capture traffic and wireshark to analyse traffic

- 'netstat' it is a cmd line tool that is used to display network connections, routing tables and network interfaces, it can
be used to see network protocol statics
- netstat -ie // gives same output as ifconfig
- netstat -r  // to display routing table
- netstat -c // display all continous listening services
- netstat -a // display all current connections
- netstat -at | less  // this will show only tcp connections
- netstat -l | less   // this show the programs which r in listening state
- netstat -lt | less   // this will show u listening tcp connection
- netstat -lu | less   // this will show u listening udp connection
- netstat -s | less   // this will show u the statictics such as the ip packets received and delivered
- netstat -st | less  // to see statistics for the packets recived and delivered packets in tcp connection
- netstat -su | less  // to see statistics for the packets recived and delivered packets in udp connection
- netstat -p | less  // to see the pid of all connection which r available
- netstat -n | less  // to see the numberic ports which r being used by different interfaces in ur system
- netstat -an | grep  ':80'// now it will show the output for the connections with the grep entered pattern of text
- netstat -ano // it will show that which port of ur computer is connected to the port of another computer in Local Address and
Foreign Address and the if the connection is their between the local and Foreign address then the "state" would be "established"
and also tell the process ids so we can check from their that what service connection is established their such as Dropbox or
a hacker is using it. 

 arp -a // it will list the table of IP addresses with their corresponding MAC addresses, The ARP is used to find the MAC 
 address for Known IP addresses and the RARP(Reverse ARP) is to find IP addresses for known MAC addresses

- xdg-open filename // to open file

- sudo init 6 // to restart the machine
- init 0 // to shutdown the machine

- if u do cmd -> ls -l     // then u will see as o/p -> -rw-rw-r-- 1 sadanand sadanand 22 Jul 23 18:55 test
- Here in the 1st '-' means it's a normal file, if it would be 'd' then it means it is a directory and if it is 'c' then it
  is character special file, if it is 'b' then it is binary special file.,if file is 'l' it is link
- First -rw here is for the owner of the file
- Second -rw means read and write for the group of the file and
- 3rd r-- is the permission for everybody else
- 4th '1' represents the symbolic links of the file
- 5th sadanand it is the name for the owner of the file
- 6th sadanand it is the name for the group of the file
- 7th '22' it is the size of the file
- 8th 'Jul 23 18:55' is the date on which it's created
- 9th 'test' is the file name
- rwx means the read, write and execute
- To change the permissions -> chmod o+x file_name  // Here 'o' stands for others '+' is for adding the permission and '-'
  is for subtracting the permission and x is for executable, So permission for others has now executable permission.
- same way -> chmod o+w file_name    // to set permissions for the others as writeable
- chmod g+x file_name    //  to set the executable permission for group
- chmod g-wx file_name   // to set the permissions for executable and write for the group
- chmod ug=rwx file_name // this will change the permissions for the owner and the group of the file together to read, write
  and execute, '=rwx' and '+rwx' works same way
- chmod a-rwx file_name // we can use 'a' for all to set permissions for read, write and execute we could also use 
  'chmod ugo-rwx file_name' cmd
- chmod u+rw,g=rw,o+r file_name // this is for the setting seperate permissions for owner, group and others together
- chmod u-w directory_name   // to set the permissions for the owner for write in directory and lock symbol will appear on
  the directory on visual(graphical view) folder
- Note -> we can also revoke the permissions for executable from the directory, in which case the user cannot 'cd' into the
  directory

- Octal and Numerical Permissions -> Octal Permission is the numerical representation of the file permission,

 Users          Groups          Others
 r w x          r w x           r w x   // use 1 for providing the permissions and 0 for not providing permissions

// now 4+2+1 = 7 so now if u wants the owner to read, write and execute the file then u need to give the no. notation 7
// now in groups if we doesn't wants to give the write permission to the group then denote 'w' as 0 as for the negative 
   permissions, 'r' and 'x' as 1 as for the positive permissions
// hence for groups the value notation will be 4+0+1 = 5, So when ever u wants to give only read and execute permission we
   can use '5', So this way we can calculate the notations
// Hence to change permissions -> chmod 000 file_name  // so here we r saying that we r providing no permission for owner
   hence 0,n o permission for group hence 0, no permission for others hence 0 So it becomes 000
// For owner to read, write, execute and for group it is only read and execute hence cmd -> chmod 750 file_name

- If the tab is not completing the script then check the permissions for the file whether it is read only by cmd->'ls -al'
  then do cmd -> 'chmod +x file_name' to do the executable permissions for owner, group and others all together.
- To revert the permissions use cmd -> 'chmod -x file_name'

File Ownership -> Screenshot(414)
cmd -> chown user_name file_name // this will change the owner of the file to the entered user_name
cmd -> chgrp group_name file_name // this will change the owner of the file to the entered group_name

User Account Manangement cmds -> Screenshot(430)



  
Tab (Button) in Linux -> Screenshot(416), Press tab 2 times if on one press it doesn't complete the cmd this way it
 will list the available options with the same initials in the cmd or file.

I/O Redirection -> to capture output from one file or program and send it to another file and program
- output_cmd > file_name // syntax for redirection
- cat > file_name // to write something in the file, it will also create file if not created and data will we overwritten if                
                  //  it already contains some data in it
- cat >> file_name // this will append the data with the previous data in the file not overwrite it 
Redirect cmds -> Screenshot(417)
- cat filename1 filename2 > filename3 // this will add the data of filename1 and filename2 and store it in filename3
- cat filename1 >> filename2 // this will add the data of filename1 to filename2

- echo string or echo "string"          // to display the string it is best practice to use "" with string
- myvar="Sadanand"                      // This is variable initialization, don't provide space before and after '='
  echo $myvar                           // to display the value of 'myvar' variable
- echo "My name is $myvar"              // to use variable to display string
- echo -e 'Some \text'                  // here 't' of word 'text' will be escaped bcz we use -e, O/P -> Some ext
- echo -e 'Some \n text'  // o/p -> Some
                                    text

tee cmd -> Screenshot(418) // if tee is used on the existing file then the data in that file would be overwritten
cmd -> echo 'Data'| tee -a file_name // this will not overwrite the data instead it will append the new into existing data
cmd -> echo 'Data'| tee  file1 file2 file3 // for multiple files

Pipes cmd -> Screenshot(419) 

more cmd -> it display one page data of a file at a time, to display futher data press 'space' button and 'q' for exit

File Maintenance Commands -> Screenshot(420) 

chown owner_name:group_name file_name // this will change the ownership and group together for a file

cmd -> exit // to logout from the current user

Linux Logs ->
- cat /var/log/syslog   // keeps logging information of system for lot of things
Note -> If u don't keep ur log files in check on linux it will grow too big, check for other logs in '/var/log' directory


Filters/ Text Processors Commands -> Screenshot(421)

File Display Commands -> Screenshot(422)
- cmd -> cut -c position_no_of_char_in_sentence file_name // this will display the character from each line to the
given position starting from 1.
- cmd -> cut -c position1-position2 file_name	// here we r providing range

- awk '{print $position}' file_name	// this will give the word from the each line at the mentioned position

- file_name |sort |uniq	// it removes the duplicate from the file, always use 'sort' cmd before 'uniq' otherwise uniq
	won't work
	
Compare Files -> Screenshot(423)
- cmd -> diff file1 file2 // tells the difference between two files line by line
- cmd -> cmp file1 file2 // tells the difference in files in respect of bytes 

- 'tar' cmd is used to create, maintain, modify and extract files which r archived in the tar(Tape Archive) format, tar is an
  archiving file format just like zip file
- tar -cvf        // 'c' for creating an archive, 'v' for verbose, 'f' allows u to specify the file name if it not used then
                  // linux is going to create a Zip file which is going to be system dependent and it's name is not defined
                  // by u
- tar -cvf  name_of_file_u_wants_to_give.tar file_name_which_has_to_be_compresed  // this will compress the file to tar, it's
                                                                                  // better to give .tar extension in the name
                                                                                  // for the file u r going to create
- tar -xvf  name_of_tar_file        // to will decompress the file
- tar -czvf name_of_file_u_wants_to_give.tar.gz file_name_which_has_to_be_compresed //here 'z' will create the file with gz
                                                                                    // format
- tar -xzvf file_name.tar.gz        // to decompress gz format file
Note -> tar cmd is not suitable to compress instead we should use 'gzip'
- cmd -> gzip file_name // this cmd will compress the file
- cmd -> gzip -d file_name // this will uncompress the file

truncate -> Screenshot(424) // it start removing the size for the file by deleting the data in file from end point in file,
on increasing the size using the truncate cmd it will add the data just increase the size of the file

Combining and Spliting Files -> Screenshot(425) // if u don't put the name for the split file it might name as 'xaa' and next
time it will overwrite the same file with name as 'xaa'

Windows Vs Linux cmds -> Screenshot(426)

apt-get update --fix-missing // to only install which r missing
apt-get install -y openvas	// if we use -y it will not ask for surity to install while installing the module
