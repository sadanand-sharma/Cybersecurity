Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link layer (layer 2) communications protocol between two routers directly without any host 
or any other networking in between. It can provide connection authentication, transmission encryption, and compression.
In PPP the layout of the PPP port parameters changes considerably according to the used lower layer port type such as
PPP over SYNC LOWPO -> 1
PPP over Frame-Relay LOWPO -> 101
PPP over ISDN LOWPO -> 17
PPP over EIR(S-link) LOWPO -> 200
PPP over EIR(P-link) LOWPO -> 200
LOWPO is Identifier of the lower level Abilis CPX port (1 - 999, NONE)
Sets the lower level port; it can be any P-LINK or an S-LINK port.
The value "NONE" makes the PPP port unusable.

WMI - // Windows Management Instrumentation is a set of specifications from Microsoft for consolidating the management of devices and
    applications in a network from Windows computing systems.
// This issue can occur when the default configuration of the Windows Firewall program blocks incoming network traffic for
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) connection. For the connection to succeed, the remote computer must permit incoming
network traffic on TCP ports 135, 445, and additional dynamically-assigned ports, typically in the range of 1024 to 1034.

##_02 Extra Points

https://academy.ehacking.net/courses/409754/lectures/6250711

Terminologies ->

- Hack value defines the value that whether something is worth doing it or not.

- Payload is the part of an exploit code that performs the intended malicious action. 

- In Daisy Chainning the attacker will not get the access of the particular machine but it can get an access to a machine in that
environmnet so this way the attacker can now reach to the target machine by going through the machines linked to it.

- Leaking the PII(Personal Identity Information) of an individual. 

- A software has unknown weaknesses and the developer has currently no-day knowledge means no knowledge of it but the hacker knows it
and most of the times sell it on Dark Net and exploit the software which comes as a surprise to the developer and patches r not 
available that soon or we can say that An attack that exploits the computer application vulnerabilites before the software developer
releases a patch for that vulnerability.
 
- Bots r simple softwares that can be controlled remotely to automate attacks, Ex -> DDOS attacks

- Elemets of Security : CIA Traid -> Confidentiality -> Integreity -> Availability -> Authenticity -> Non-Repudation

- Non-Repudation -> It will not allow a person to deny from the work that person has done, such as a person can not deny that
  if he has sent the mail or not.

- Bit Flipping -> It is an attack on a cryptographic cipher in which the attacker can change the ciphertext in such a way as
  to result in a predictable change of the plaintext, although the attacker is not able to learn the plaintext itself. Note
  that this type of attack is not—directly—against the cipher itself, but against a particular message or series of messages.
  In the extreme, this could become a Denial of service attack against all messages on a particular channel using that cipher

Insecure direct object reference is a type of vulnerability where the application does not verify if the user is authorized
 to access the internal object via its name or key. 

Bufferoverflow ->
Buffer overflow is kind of Application level attack, This attack is more related to the memory of the computer in sense that
u keep sending a additional information to an application, and once the application recieve information it will keep it in
memory and every application has a specific location into the memory were he can save all the user input, now if u input more
information then the allocated memory to the application now if the developer has keep this thing in consideration the
application would not accept the extra input but otherwise the input would be accepted and that extra information would be
saved in different locations of the memory not just in the memory which is allocated to the application.

- Some locations in memory r very critical if u r able to reach them from remote computer u can control whatever being
  executing on this computer.
- Inside the memory their r some specific locations, those locations r place where they r controlling what application
should be running, now during fuzzing if those characters have reached those critical locations that means we can customerize
characters by sending some code in place of them and enforce the memory to execute that code.
- 'Immunity Debugger' program is used to map memory, this tool has to be associated with specific program or we can say the
application on which the buffer overflow is to be tested, It trace the input and output of the memory for one specific
application.
- 'EIP' which is very important place inside memory, EIP is the place in memory that control the flow or decide what program
 to be executed, EIP can only accept 4 characters, another important place is 'ESP', it's like a container that holds the
 program that will be executed.
- if u find out that EIP and ESP has been overwritten with the character send by the Fuzzer program to this program that
 means the attacker is able to reach the critical place inside the memory, the characters which r overwriting these locations
 will be in format of Hexadecimal 
 
Ways to identify if program has buffer overflow ->
- 1st way - After footprinting u will know some applications or OS also which r available on victim machine
- 2nd way (Reverse Engineering) -> In this u need to analyse the code of the OS or some open source applications
- 3rd way (Test application urself for buffer overflow) -> This is like above ex of sikabomb
 
Bufferoverflow attack that allow access to a remote system is in which the attacker overwhelms a system or application,
causing it to crash and then redirects the memory address to read from a location holding the payload.
By manipulating a buffer overflow, an attacker can jump:
- To a function in the program
- To one of the program's libraries
- To a buffer he/she has created

A buffer overflow can change the return address of a function

Heap is the name for the dynamic memory space that, unlike the stack, doesn’t rely on sequential ordering or organization
Stack based and Heap based r types of buffer overflow 
It is possible to make the stack non-executable.
Stack bufferoverflows r also known as Stack smashing, it is bufferoverflow that overwrites the return address.
It is common for buffer overflows to occur in the heap memory space. Application dynamically allocates heap memory as needed
through a function. This function is called malloc().

Java, Python, Ruby < C, C++, Assembly : in respect to programming languages less vulenrable to bufferoverflow attacks
Java is not susceptible to a stack-based buffer overflow attack.

strcopy(), strcat(), streadd() r C/C++ functions that should be avoided because they create buffer overflow vulnerabilities. 
other functions vulenrable to bufferoverflows r strcpy, gets, sprintf
In the case of C and C++ languages, there are no automatic bounds checks on buffers.

Canaries or canary words are known values that are placed between a buffer and control data on the stack to monitor buffer
overflows. When the buffer overflows, the first data to be corrupted will usually be the canary, and a failed verification
of the canary data will therefore alert of an overflow, which can then be handled, for example, by invalidating the
corrupted data. A canary value should not be confused with a sentinel value.
sentinel value (also referred to as a flag value, trip value, rogue value, signal value, or dummy data) is a special
value in the context of an algorithm which uses its presence as a condition of termination, typically in a loop or recursive
algorithm.
Canaries are alternately known as cookies, which is meant to evoke the image of a "broken cookie" when the value is
corrupted - Udemy Practice test _3 Question 19
There are three types of canaries in use: terminator, random, and random XOR. Current versions of StackGuard support all 
three, while ProPolice supports terminator and random canaries.

In StackGuard, whenever a function is called, code is added that pushes a small value called a canary value over to the 
stack.
StackGuard can use the value of "0" as the canary value even though it is easily guessed by the attacker
When performing a buffer overflow attack against a system protected by SafeSEH - If the canary is known, an attacker could
potentially pass the canary check code by overwriting the canary with its known value, and controlling information with
mismatched values.

Splint is a source code analyzer that is capable of detecting a bufferoverflow

Buffer overflows does not lead to remote code executions

Countermeasures against buffer overflow attack->
- Canary(Security Cookie)
- setting the NX bit 
- address space layout randomization 
- write secure code

Buffer overflow attacks allow an attacker to modify the target process's address space in order to control the process
execution, crash the process and modify internal variables. 

Buffer overrun is considered to be a violation of memory safety

NOP - Attackers may place a Null Operation (NOP) instruction code at beginning of string in buffer overflow attack process.
- Udemy Practice test 3 Question 47

A Hash Collision Attack is an attempt to find two input strings of a hash function that produce the same hash result. Bcz 
hash functions have infinite input length and a predefined output length, there is inevitably going to be the possibility
of two different inputs that produce the same output hash. If two separate inputs produce the same hash output, it is called
a collision. This collision can then be exploited by any application that compares two hashes together – such as password
hashes, file integrity checks, etc.

CHAP(Challenge Handshake Authentcation Protocol) is an authentication protocol in which a new random number is generated
uniquely for each login session

Clickjacking - Clickjacking is when a cybercriminal tricks a user into clicking a link that seemingly takes them one place
but instead routes them to the attacker’s chosen destination most often for malicious purposes. Clickjacking is also known as
redressing or IFRAME overlay. In many cases, the user may not realize that their clicks aren't going where they're supposed
to, which can open up a number of vulnerabilities.
- Udemy Practice test __3 Question 125

Vandalism - is damage or destruction that takes place in digital form. Instead of keying someone's car, cyber vandals may
deface a website (such as Wikipedia), create malware that damages electronic files or elements that interrupt its normal
utilization or remove a disk drive to disable a computer system.

Mail relay -> An open relay (sometimes called an insecure relay or a third-party relay) is an SMTP e-mail server that allows
third-party relay of e-mail messages. By processing mail that is neither for nor from a local user, an open relay makes it
possible for an unscrupulous sender to route large volumes of spam. In effect, the owner of the server -- who is typically
unaware of the problem -- donates network and computer resources to the sender's purpose. In addition to the financial costs
incurred when a spammer hijacks a server, an organization may also suffer system crashes, equipment damage, and loss of
business.

- Udemy Practice test ___6 Question 32

Mitigation - means the act of reducing the severity or seriousness of the impact of something on a situation. IT Threat
mitigation is therefore defined as the corrective actions, prevention or remedies put in place to combat or reduce IT
threats on a computer, server or network.

lookup - A procedure in which a table of values stored in a computer is searched until a specified value is found.

Anycast - Anycast addressing is a one-to-one-of-many association where datagrams are routed to any single member of a
group of potential receivers that are all identified by the same destination address. The routing algorithm selects the
single receiver from the group based on least-expensive routing metric. In practice, this means that packets are routed to
the topologically-nearest member of an anycast group. Anycasting in the Internet architecture was first described in
RFC 1546
Anycast is a network addressing and routing methodology in which a single destination address has multiple routing paths
to two or more endpoint destinations. Routers will select the desired path on the basis of number of hops, distance, lowest
cost, latency measurements or based on the least congested route. Anycast networks are widely used for content delivery
network (CDN) products to bring their content closer to the end user.

OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities in Web Applications->

 attackers tamper this serialized data
- Using Components with known Vulnerabilites
- Insufficient logging and Monitoring

DMZ -> 
Running a network scan to detect network services in the corporate DMZ is a security operation used for determining the
attack surface of an orgnaization

Shellshock ->
Shellshock, also known as Bashdoor, is a family of security bugs in the widely used Unix Bash shell. One specific exploitation 
vector of the Shellshock bug is CGI-based web servers.Note: When a web server uses the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) to handle
a document request, it passes various details of the request to a handler program in the environment variable list. For
example, the variable HTTP_USER_AGENT has a value that, in normal usage, identifies the program sending the request. If the request
handler is a Bash script, or if it executes one for example using the system call, Bash will receive the environment variables 
passed by the server and will process them. This provides a means for an attacker to trigger the Shellshock vulnerability with
a specially crafted server request.References: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)#Specific_exploitation_vectors

- Most common method to exploit the “Bash Bug” or “ShellShock" vulnerability is through web servers utilizing CGI(Common
Gateway Interface) to send a malformed environment variable to a vunerable web server
- Shellshock is a vulnerability in GNU's bash shell, discovered in September of 2014 that gives attackers access to run
 remote commands on a vulnerable System. The malicious software can take control of an infected machine, Launch DoS attacks
 to disrupt websites, and scan for other Vulnerable devices (including routers).
- Shellshock allowed an unauthorized user to gain access to a server. It affected many Internet-facing services, windows is
 directly affected by it.

- Race Condition -> When two conditions occur at the same time and there is a chance that arbitary commands can be executed
with a user's elevated permissions, which can then be used by the adversary.
// When a race condition occurs, either process may occur. If the timing is right, arbitrary commands may be executed with
 the current user level privileges until the next process begins.

ISAPI filters - To defend against Web Server attacks

SSO(Single Sign On) is a access control mechanism allows for multiple systems to use a Central Authentication Server (CAS)
that permits users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems.



Covert Channels -> 
A covert channel is a type of attack that creates a capability to transfer information objects between processes that are not
supposed to be allowed to communicate by the computer security policy.
A covert channel is so called because it is hidden from the access control mechanisms of secure operating systems since it
does not use the legitimate data transfer mechanisms of the computer system (typically, read and write), and therefore cannot
be detected or controlled by the security mechanisms that underlie secure operating systems. Covert channels are exceedingly
hard to install in real systems, and can often be detected by monitoring system performance.
- They r normally used as layered approach for hiding the data in ICMP traffic
- A stego is sent as a secret information that is embedded in normal traffic
- It is a channel that transfers information over, within a computer system or network that is outside of the security policy
- Udemy Practice test __2 Question 94
- Udemy Practice test ___6 Question 30
- Udemy Practice test ___6 Question 39

- Evil twin attack is an attack type for a rogue Wi-Fi access point that appears to be a legitimate one offered on the
 premises but actually has been set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications. It is the wireless version of the phishing
 scam. An attacker fools wireless users into connecting a laptop or mobile phone to a tainted hotspot by posing as a
 legitimate provider. This type of attack may be used to steal the passwords of unsuspecting users by either snooping the
 communication link or by phishing, which involves setting up a fraudulent web site and luring people there.

- Disabling the router from accepting broadcast ping msgs  is a successful method for protecting a router from potential 
 smurf attacks

- Watering Hole Attack - Initiating an attack against targeted businesses and organizations, threat actors compromise a
 carefully selected website by inserting an exploit resulting in malware infection. The attackers run exploits on well-known
 and trusted sites likely to be visited by their targeted victims. Aside from carefully choosing sites to compromise, these
 attacks are known to incorporate zero-day exploits that target unpatched vulnerabilities.
 Thus, the targeted entities are left with littleor no defense against these exploits.

- UDP protocol is used to carry out a fraggle attack

- Code injection is a form of attack in which a malicious user inserts text into a data field that gets interpreted as code

- Meet-in-the-middle attack is the known plaintext attack used against DES which gives the result that encrypting plaintext
 with one DES key followed by encrypting it with a second DES key is no more secure than using a single key
 
- An IPS can have rules set that can dissect a packet to, for example, inspect the contents in hex or binary format.
- Udemy Practice test _2 Question 51

- Which of the following best defines a logical or technical control?
- Security Tokens
// A logical (or technical) control is one used for identification, authentication, and authorization. It can be embedded 
 inside an operating system, application, or database management system. A security token (such as RSA’s SecureID) can
 provide a number that changes on a recurring basis that a user must provide during authentication, or it may provide a
 built-in number on a USB device that must be attached during authentication. A physical control is something, well, 
 physical in nature, such as a lock or key or maybe a guard.
 
- Which of the following best describes an intranet zone?
- It has few heavy security restrictions
// The intranet can be thought of, for testing purposes, as your own happy little networking safe space. It’s protected from
 outside attacks and interference by the DMZ and all the layers of security on the outside.
 
- You are the security administration for your local city. You just installed a new IPS. Other than plugging it in and 
applying some basic IPS rules, no other configuration has been made. You come in the next morning and you discover that
 there was a so much activity generated by the IPS in the logs that it is too time consuming to view. What most likely
 caused the huge influx of logs from the IPS? 
- There was no baseline established
//The administrator plugged in the intrusion prevention system (IPS) and applied too few rules. The administrator did not
 establish a baseline, which would have tailored the alerts to an appropriate level based on the LAN activity during certain
 hours of the day.
 
- Logs could be used to monitor application errors and violations on a web server or application
 
 
- In step 1, the host sends a segment to the server, indicating it wants to open a communications session. Inside this 
 segment, the host turns on the SYN flag and sets an initial sequence number (any random 32-bit number). When the recipient
 gets the segment, it crafts a segment in response to let the host know it’s open and ready for the communications session.
 It does this by turning on the SYN and ACK flags, acknowledging the initial sequence number by incrementing it, and adding
 its own unique sequence number. Lastly, when the host gets this response back, it sends one more segment before the comm
 channel opens. In this segment, it sets the ACK flag and acknowledges the other’s sequence number by incrementing it.

- The Privacy Act of 1974 protects information of a personal nature, including Social Security numbers. The Privacy Act 
defines exactly what “personal information” is, and it states that government agencies cannot disclose any personal 
information about an individual without that person’s consent.

- A gray-box test is designed to replicate an inside attacker. Otherwise known as the partial knowledge attack (don’t forget
 this term), the idea is to simulate a user on the inside who might know a little about the network or directory structure 
 in your enterprise. 

Salting is a password protection technique in which random strings of characters are added to the password before calculating

Digital rights management (DRM) is a systematic approach to copyright protection for digital media.

In security, piggybacking, similar to tailgating, refers to when a person tags along with another person who is authorized 
to gain entry into a restricted area, or pass a certain checkpoint.

DNSSec - DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are a set of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards created to address
vulnerabilities in the Domain Name System (DNS) and protect it from online threats. The purpose of DNSSEC is to increase

LDAP(Lightweigth Directory Access Protocol) is open standard internet protocol, LDAP is for accessing and maintaining 
distributed directory information services in a hierachial and logical structure. It also provides a central place to
store usernames and passwords, application and services connect to the LDAP server to validate users. the client initiates
an LDAP session by sending an operation request to Directory System Agent(DSA) using TCP port 389.

LDAP injection is a technique that also take advantage of non-validated input vulnerability

NTP(Network Time Protocol) is used in network to synchronize clocks across the host and network devices; directory services
netork devices and host rely on clock settings for login purposes and to keep records of events , its whole communication 
is based on coordinated universal time(UTC)

NTP uses a term stratrum to describe distance between NTP server and devices, stratum value starts from 1 and increases by
every HOP

NTP latest version NTPv3 and later version support a cryptographic authentication technique between NTP peers, the
 authentication can be used to mitigate an attack.

NTP tools -> NTP commands, nmap, NSE scripts 

Attacker generates queries to NTP server to extract valuable infromation from the responses such as->
- Host information connected to NTP server
- Client IP address, Machine name, OS information
- Network information such as internal IPs depend upon deployement of NTP server, i.e. if NTP server is deployed in DMZ

ntpdc is used to query the ntpd daemon regarding current state and request changes in state.

ntptrace is a Perl script uses ntpq to follow the chain of NTP servers from a given host back to primary time source

##_08 vulnerability assessment

Vulnerabiltiy Assessment can be defined as a process of examination, discovery and identification of system and applications
security measures and weaknesses, it help to recognize the vulnerabilites that could be exploited, need of additional
security layers and other information that can be revealed using scanners.

Probing -> 
- In telecommunications generally, a probe is an action taken or an object used for the purpose of learning something about
 the state of the network. For example, an empty message can be sent simply to see whether the destination actually exists.
 Ping is a common utility for sending such a probe.
- A probe is a program or other device inserted at a key juncture in a network for the purpose of monitoring or collecting
 data about network activity.
- Relative to computer security in a network, a probe is an attempt to gain access to a computer and its files through a
 known or probable weak point in the computer system.
- In semiconductor testing, a probe card is a microchip placed in a circuit in order to test its signals.

Types of Vulnerability Assessment ->
- Active // actively sending requests to the live network and examining the response, means process of assessment which 
requires probing the target host
- Passive // it includes packet sniffing to discover vulnerabilites, running services, open ports etc
- External // process of assessment with hacking perspective to exploit vulnerabilites from outside
- Internal // discovering vulnerabilites by scanning internal network and infrastructure

Vulnerability Assessment life cycle phases ->
- creating baseline // is a pre-assessment phase to identify nature of corporate network, applications and services. create 
a inventory of all resources and assessts which helps to manage, prioritize the assessment, maps the infrastructure, learns
about security controls, policies and standards of organization 
- vulnerability assessment // includes examination and inspection of security measures such as physical security, policies
and controls. The target is evaluated for misconfiguration, default configuration, faults and other vulnerabilites using
probing or assessment tools, finding r ranked in terms of their priorites
- risk assessment // scoping the identified vulnerabilites and their impact on corporate network or on organization 
- remediation // includes remedial actions for detected vulnerabilites
- verification // ensures all vulnerabilites in an environment r eliminated
- monitor // this phase includes monitoring the network traffic and system behaviours for any further intrusion

Different approaches for vulnerability assessment->
- Product based solution vs Service based solution ->
Product based solutions r deployed within the corporate network of an organization or a private(internal) network.
Service based solutions r third party solutions which offers security and auditing to a network, these solutions can
be host either inside or outside the network

- Tree based assessment vs Inference based assessment
Tree based assessment approach in which auditor follows different strategies for each component of environment such as
different approach for windows based machines and different for linux based servers.
Inference based assessment approach depends on the inventory of protocols in an environment, if an auditor found a protocol
using inference based assessment approach, the auditor will investigate for ports and services related to that protocol.

Best practice or recommended steps for vulnerability assessment->
- Before starting any vulnerabiltiy assessment tool on a network, the auditor must understand the complete functionality 
of that assessment tool, this will help to select appropriate tool to extract ur desired information
- Make sure about the assessment tool that it will not cause any sort of damage or unavilability of services running on
network
- Make sure about the source location of scan to reduce the focus area
- Run scan frequently for vulnerabilites

PRISM (Planning tool for resource integration stands for Synchronization and Management)

By default aging time of CAM table MAC addresses is 300 seconds 

- Udemy Practice test 3 Question 48

MAC flooding -> in this attacker sends random MAC addresses mapped with random IP to overflow the storage capacity of CAM
table, due to which switch acts as hub which will broadcast packet on all ports which helps the attacker to sniff packet
with ease. In linux/unix we can use the 'macof' utility for this task.
// Macof is a member of the 'Dsniff suit toolset' and mainly used to flood the switch on a local network with MAC addresses.
Countermeasure -> Configure Port Security on the Switch

Switch Port Scanning -> Is a packet sniffing technique that uses MAC flooding to sniff packets, the attacker sends bogus
ARP packet with the source MAC address of the target and destination address of it's own as the attacker is impersonating
the target host

Defence against MAC attacks is done by Port security, in dynamic port security u configure total no. of allowed MAC address

DHCP starvation attack is an attack that targets DHCP servers whereby forged DHCP requests are crafted by an attacker with the
intent of exhausting all available IP addresses that can be allocated by the DHCP server. Under this attack, legitimate network
users can be denied service.

DHCP attack types ->
- DHCP starvation attack, tools -> dhcpstarv and yersinia
- rogue DHCP server attack // this is performed by deploying the rogue DHCP server in the network along with Starvation
attack

Defending against DHCP starvation and Rogue server attack ->
- DHCP snooping // this feature is enabled on networking devices to identify the only trusted ports from DHCP traffic either
in ingress or egress direction is considered legimate
- Port security

ARP Spoofing ->
ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over
a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer
or server on the network. Once the attacker’s MAC address is connected to an authentic IP address, the attacker will begin
receiving any data that is intended for that IP address. ARP spoofing can enable malicious parties to intercept, modify or
even stop data in-transit. ARP spoofing attacks can only occur on local area networks that utilize the Address Resolution
Protocol. - Udemy Practice test 3 Question 40

To defend against ARP spoofing->
- Use ARPWall system and block ARP spoofing attacks //ARPwall is used in protecting against ARP spoofing.
- Use Private VLANs
- Place static ARP entries on servers, workstation and routers.

ARP spoofing can be used for ->
- Session Hijacking
- DoS attack
- MITM attack
- Packet Sniffing
- Data Interception
- Connection hijacking
- VoIP tapping
- Connection reseting
- Stealing password

ARP poisioning is done by sending the ARP reply to every machine without ARP request and this will make the all MAC address
table updated and this way the attacker machine will be able to pretend as the Router and all the traffic will be diverted
to this attacker machine.

To verify the ARP spoofing and Poinsioning -> cmd -> arp -a // this will tell u the table for the earlier ARP request and
reply and from here u can see the router MAC address -@@

Defending ARP poisioning 
- DAI(Dynamic ARP Inspection) is used with DHCP snooping, IP to MAC bindings can be track from DHCP transcations to protect
against ARP poisioning - Udemy Practice test _3 Question 34, - Udemy Practice test __1 Question 85

Spoofing attack ->
- MAC Spoofing/Duplicating is a technique of manupulating MAC address to impersonate the legimate user to attack such as
DoS attack, duplicating the MAC can intercept the traffic and traffic for user may direct to attacker.
Countermeasure -> 
- Configure Port Secuirty on Switch
- use the commanD. ip dhcp snooping binding. - https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive ques 36

Techniques for scanning vulnerable machines ->
- Random // infect machnes randomly from IP space, on finding vulnerable machine it breaks into it and infect with script,
  this spread the infection very quickly and compromise large no. of hosts
- Hit-list // attacker creates the list of potential vulenrable machines and infect it, once the machine is infected the half
of the list is assigned to this newly infected system, this also spread malicious code in short period of time
- Topological // gathers information from infected system to find other vulnerable targets
- subnet scanning // to attempt scanning behind the firewall where compromised host scan for vulnerable targets in its own
local network, this technique is used to from a large army of zombies
- permutation // it uses the pseudorandom permutation of IP address if a system is infected by any technique mentioned above

RUDY -> R.U.D.Y. is a popular low and slow attack tool that is designed to crash a web server by submitting long form fields
. The attack is executed via a DoS tool which browses the target website and detects embedded web forms. Once the forms have
been identified, R.U.D.Y. sends a legitimate HTTP POST request with an abnormally long ‘content-length’ header field and
then t starts injecting the form with information, one byte-sized packet at a time
Udemy Practice test ___6 Question 98

DoS/DDoS Attack tools ->
- Pandora DDoS bot toolkit ,attack types ->
     - HHP min
	 - HTTP Download
	 - HTTP combo
	 - Socket combo
	 - Mac Flood
- Derail
- HOIC
- DoS HTTP
- BanglaDoS

- Pyloris (tool for SYN flood attack more effective for linux server based websites)

The SYN flood attack sends TCP connections requests faster than a machine can process them.
Attacker creates a random source address for each packet
SYN flag set in each packet is a request to open a new connection to the server from the
spoofed IP address
Victim responds to spoofed IP address,then waits for confirmation that never arrives (timeout
wait is about 3 minutes)
Victim's connection table fills up waiting for replies and ignores new connections
Legitimate users are ignored and will not be able to access the server

To protect ur network from SYN flood attack measures r ->
- SYN cookies. Instead of allocating a record,send a SYN-ACK with a carefully constructed
sequence number generated as a hash of the clients IP address,port number,and other
information. When the client responds with a normal ACK,that special sequence number will
beincluded,which the server then verifies. Thus,the server first allocates memory on the third
packet of the handshake,not the first.
- RST cookies - The server sends a wrong SYN/ACK back to the client. The client should then
generate a RST packet telling the server that something is wrong. At this point,the server knows
the client is valid and will now accept incoming connections from that client normally
- Stack Tweaking. TCP stacks can be tweaked in order to reduce the effect of SYN floods.
Reduce the timeout before a stack frees up the memory allocated for a connection
- Micro Blocks. Instead of allocating a complete connection,simply allocate a micro record of 16-
bytes for the incoming SYN object

DoS/DDoS attack tools mobile ->

https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive ques 57
   
network level session hijacking is focused on transport and internet layer protocols used by application layer, types ->
- blind hijacking // in this the attacker is not able to capture response traffic from target but can get traffic from victim
- UDP hijacking
- TCP/IP Hijacking // attacker predicts sequence no., attacker must be on same network with victim
- RST hijacking // acknowledgment no. is predicted, sending RST packet with spoofed source address
- MITM (using Forged ICMP and ARP spoofing)
- IP spoofing - Udemy Practice test _1 Question 33

Session hijacking can be performed on all of the protocols such as FTP, HTTP, SMTP except IPSec

Internet Protocol Security IPSec is actually a suite of protocols. Each protocol within the suite provides different 
functionality. Collective IPSec does everything except work at the Data link layer

IPsec protocol is used for setting up secured channels between two devices, typically in VPNs.

PSK(Pre-shared keys) - Udemy Practice test _3 Question 13

##_15 Evading IDS Firewall and Honeypots

IPS may also become a single point of failure for whole network
If 'fail-open' mode is used the good and malicious traffic will be allowed in case of any kind of failure within IPS
sensor. Similarly if 'fail-close' mode is configured the whole IP traffic will be dropped in case of sensors failure.

Inline deployement of IPS and Sensor deployement of IDS -> Do from PDF Page 3

IDS and IPS comparision  -> Do from PDF Page 3

Ways to detect an Intrusion ->
- Signature based IDS/IPS
- Policy based IDS/IPS
- Anomaly based IDS/IPS
- Reputation based IDS/IPS

Signature based IDS/IPS -> A signature looks for some specific string or behaviour in a single packet or stream of packets 
to detect the anomaly, Cisco constantly updates the signature set which also needs to upload to a device by the network
administrator
Not all signatures r enabled by default

Policy based IDS/IPS -> It works based on the policy or SOP of an organization such as their could be policy that every
management session with networking devices must not initiate TELNET protocol and then when ever TELNET traffic hits the
IPS an alert will be generated followed by the drop of packets

Reputation based IDS/IPS -> collects the information from systems participating in global co-relation, it include relative
descriptors like known URLs, domain names etc

Advantages and dis-advantages of different IDS and IPS sensors -> Do from PDF Page 6

Types of Intrusion Detection systems - IDS/IPS modules r deployed in one of the following configurations ->
- Host based intrusion detection
- Network based intrusion detection

Host based IDS/IPS is normally deployed for the protection of specific host machine and it works closely with the OS kernel
of the host machine, it creates a filtering layer and filters out any malicious application call to OS 

Four major types of Host based IDS/IPS ->
- File Monitoring System -> IDS/IPS works by closely comparing the versions of files within some directory with the previous
versions of same file and checks for any unauthorized tampering and changing within a file. Hashing algorithms r often used
to verfiy the integrity of files and directories.
- Log Files Analysis -> IDS/IPS works by analyzing the log files of the host machine and generates warning for system administrator
who r responsible for machine security 
- Connection analysis ->  IDS/IPS works by monitoring the overall network connections being made with the secure machine and
tries to figure out which of them r legimate and how many of them r unauthorized, EX of techniques used r  open ports scanning
half open and rogue TCP connections etc
- Kernel Level Detection -> THe kernel of OS itself detects the changing within the system binaries and an anomaly in 
system calls to detect the intrusion attempts on that machine

The network based IPS solution works inline with the perimeter edge device r some specific segment of the overall network.

Rainbow tables -> A rainbow table is generally an offline only attack. In a brute force attack or dictionary attack, you
 need to spend time either sending your guess to the real system to running through the algorithm offline. Given a slow
 hashing or encryption algorithm, this wastes time. Also, the work being done cannot be reused.
 A rainbow table is precomputed listing. You actually work backwards from the hashed/encrypted text. The attacker will run
 through the algorithm to get every possible output given every possible input. The list of inputs may be brute force, 
 dictionary, or hybrid. Based on the list of outputs, the attacker now has a reuseable table mapping inputs to known outputs

cards.

- Using SQL queries such ' or 1=1 is a method called fuzzing. This technique is used to test for SQL injection 
vulnerabilities.

- Which of the following is defined as ensuring the enforcement of organizational security policy does not rely on voluntary
 user compliance by assigning sensitivity labels on information and comparing this to the level of security a user is
 operating at?
- Mandatory Access Control
// Access control is defined as the selective restraint of access to a resource, and there are several overall mechanisms to
 accomplish this goal. Mandatory access control (MAC) is one type that constrains the ability of a subject to access or
 perform an operation on an object by assigning and comparing “sensitivity labels.”
 
 
- What is the downside of using SSH with Telnet when it comes to security?
- u can see what the adversary is doing
//Using SSH is great for security, but in order to learn from what the adversary is doing is no longer feasible because of
 the encryption that is taking place.
 
- A security assessment where one team (red) acts as aggressors while the other (blue) acts in a defensive posture. The idea
is to improve security overall because we’re all supposed to be working towards the same goal. In any case, if you’re a
defence person, you’re blue team.
 
- If you are able to ping and even visit an external website using its IP address and not its fully qualified domain name
 (FQDN), it is more probable that the DNS sever is having issues. Check with the DNS server for functionality.

- The Melisa virus occurred on March 26, 1999, and quickly infected over 100,000 computers in a three-day span. The virus
 exploited the fact that macros were enabled by default within the Microsoft Office suite. Using the macro feature, the
 Melissa virus populated with ease when the victims opened their documents. The macro then executed and emailed contacts
 found within Microsoft Outlook, causing widespread infections.
 

- A machine in your environment uses an open X-server to allow remote access. The X-server access control is disabled,
 allowing connections from almost anywhere and with little to no authentication measures. Which of the following are true
 statements regarding this situation? (Choose all that apply.)
- An internal and external both threat can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server vulnerability

- Your network contains certain servers that typically fail once every five years. The total cost of one of these servers is
 $1000. Server technicians are paid $40 per hour, and a typical replacement requires two hours. Ten employees, earning an
 average of $20 per hour, rely on these servers, and even one of them going down puts the whole group in a wait state until
 it’s brought back up. Which of the following represents the ARO for a server?
- 0.20
// When performing business impact analysis (or any other value analysis for that matter), the annualized loss expectancy
 (ALE) is an important measurement for every asset. To compute the ALE, multiply the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) by
 the single loss expectancy (SLE). The ARO is the frequency at which a failure occurs on an annual basis. In this example,
 servers fail once every five years, so the ARO would be 1 failure/5 years = 20 percent.
 - Udemy Practice test ___6 Question 24
 
- Your organization is planning for the future and is identifying the systems and processes critical for their continued 
operation. Which of the following best describes this effort?
- BIA - Udemy Practice test __1 Question 21
// A business impact analysis (BIA) best matches this description. In a BIA, the organization looks at all the systems and 
processes in use and determines which ones are absolutely critical to continued operation. Additionally, the assessor (the 
person or company conducting the analysis) will look at all the existing security architecture and make an evaluation on the
 likelihood of any system or resource being compromised. Part of this is assigning values to systems and services, 
 determining the maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) for any, and identifying any overlooked vulnerabilities.
 
- CEH methodology is laid out this way: reconnaissance (footprinting), scanning and enumeration, gaining access, escalating 
privileges, maintaining access, and covering tracks.

- Incident management is a process of dealing with incidents and generally always has the same features/steps—identify the
 problem or root cause, analyze and research the issue, contain the malicious effort, eradicate the effort, and resolve any
 damage caused.
 
- Searching through the local paper is considered passive because it does not directly impact, alert, or establish any type
 of connection between the victim and the adversary.
 
- In what phase is an attacker who is currently conducting a successful man-in-the-middle attack? 
- Maintaing Access
// If the attacker is successfully conducting a man-in-the-middle attack, he is currently maintaining access to the victim’s 
network traffic.

- In which phase of the attack would a hacker set up and configure “zombie” machines?
- Maintaining Access
// Zombies are basically machines the hacker has confiscated to do his work for him. If the attacker is really good, the
 owners of the zombie machines don’t even know their machines have been drafted into the war.

- As a network engineer, you received the task of bridging two corporate facilities by way of wireless communication. These
 facilities are more than 20 miles apart, contain more than 400 employees at each site, and have a $20,000 budget. Each site
 has a single-mode fiber connection. Which antenna would you use to bridge the gap? 
- Directional antenna
// In this scenario, you would choose the directional antenna because it focuses the radio transmission as a point-to-point 
link, unlike the omni antenna, which has 360-degree coverage. It also reduces the probability of an adversary conducting a
 war diving attack. - Udemy Practice test _2 Question 21
